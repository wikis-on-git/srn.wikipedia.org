<!-- During its history, the [[United States]] has seen many families who have repeatedly produced notable politicians from their ranks, and these '''historic U.S. political families''' have had a significant impact on politics in the United States. 

Many of these families have moved to national prominence from a [[U.S. state|state]] or regional power base. The [[Kennedy political family|Kennedys]], for example, are particularly associated with [[Massachusetts]]; the [[Huey Long|Long]] family is identified with [[Louisiana]], the [[Lee family|Lees]] with [[Virginia]], the [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelts]] with New York, the [[Daley family|Daleys]] with [[Illinois]], the [[Muhlenberg Family|Muhlenbergs]] with [[Pennsylvania]], and the [[Taft family|Tafts]] with [[Ohio]]. Other political families are less connected with a specific state; the [[Bush family]] began in [[Ohio]] and [[Connecticut]], but is now more closely identified with [[Texas]], and a member of the family was the governor of [[Florida]]. Kennedy family member [[Maria Shriver]]'s husband [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is now governor of [[California]].
